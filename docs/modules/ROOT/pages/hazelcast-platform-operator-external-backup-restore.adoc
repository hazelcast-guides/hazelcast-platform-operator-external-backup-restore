:description: Learn how to back up data in Hazelcast maps to cloud storage and restore a cluster from that backup data.

{description}

== Context
In this tutorial, you'll do the following:

- Deploy Hazelcast with persistence enabled.

- Create a Hazelcast map that has persistence enabled.

- Back up all map entries to external storage in the cloud.

- Restart the Hazelcast cluster and restore the backup map entries from the cloud.

== Before you Begin

Before starting this tutorial, make sure that you meet the following prerequisites:

* Up and running https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] cluster
* Kubernetes command-line tool, https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[kubectl]
* Deployed xref:operator:ROOT:index.adoc[Hazelcast Platform Operator]
* Created blob storage and access credentials in one of the cloud providers: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[AWS] - https://cloud.google.com/storage/[GCP] - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/[Azure]

== Step 1. Start the Hazelcast Cluster

. Create a license secret
+
Create a secret with your link:http://trialrequest.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast Enterprise License].
+
[source, shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic hazelcast-license-key --from-literal=license-key=<hz-license-key>
----

. Create the Hazelcast Cluster
+
Run the following command to create the Hazelcast cluster with Persistence enabled using External type.
+
[source, shell]
----
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: Hazelcast
metadata:
  name: my-hazelcast
spec:
  clusterSize: 3
  licenseKeySecret: hazelcast-license-key
  persistence:
    baseDir: "/data/hot-restart/"
    clusterDataRecoveryPolicy: "FullRecoveryOnly"
    pvc:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      requestStorage: 8Gi
  agent:
    repository: hazelcast/platform-operator-agent
  exposeExternally:
    type: Smart
    discoveryServiceType: LoadBalancer
    memberAccess: NodePortExternalIP
EOF
----
+
NOTE: The agent configuration is optional. If you do not pass the agent configuration, the operator directly use the latest stable version of the agent.

. Check the Cluster Status
+
Run the following commands to see the cluster status
+
[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get hazelcast my-hazelcast
NAME           STATUS    MEMBERS   EXTERNAL-ADDRESSES
my-hazelcast   Running   3/3       34.70.165.31:5701,34.70.165.31:8080
----
+
[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-hazelcast

NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-hazelcast-0   2/2     Running   0          3m43s
my-hazelcast-1   2/2     Running   0          3m16s
my-hazelcast-2   2/2     Running   0          2m50s
----
+
As you can see from the pod states, when backup is used, the Backup Agent container will
be deployed with the Hazelcast container in the same Pod. The agent is responsible for backing data up into the external storage.

. Get the Address of the Hazelcast Cluster
+
After verifying that the cluster is `Running` and all the members are ready, run the following command to find the discovery service address.

+
[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get service my-hazelcast
NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                         AGE
my-hazelcast   LoadBalancer   10.168.25.113   34.70.165.31   5701:32653/TCP,8080:32162/TCP   69m
----
+
The field `EXTERNAL-IP` is the address of your Hazelcast cluster.

== Step 2. Create Persistent Map and Put Data

. Create Persistent Map
+
Run the following command to create the Map resource with Persistence enabled.
+
[source, shell]
----
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: Map
metadata:
  name: persistent-map
spec:
  hazelcastResourceName: my-hazelcast
  persistenceEnabled: true
EOF
----

. Configure the CLC to connect to the cluster. (Option 1)
+
Before using CLC, it should be installed in your system. Check the installation instructions for CLC: xref:clc:install-clc.adoc[]
+
Run the following command for adding the cluster config to the CLC.
+
[source, bash]
----
clc config add hz-1 cluster.name=dev cluster.address=<EXTERNAL-IP>
----
+
Run the following command to fill a map.
+
[source, bash]
----
for i in {1..10};
do
   clc -c hz-1 map set --name map1 key-$i value-$i;
done
----
+
Run the following command to check the map size.
+
[source, bash]
----
clc -c hz-1 map size --name map1
----

. Configure the Hazelcast client to connect to the cluster. (Option 2) [[Configure-Client]]
+
[tabs]
====

Java::
+
--
[source, java]
----
ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();
config.getNetworkConfig().addAddress("<EXTERNAL-IP>");
----
--

NodeJS::
+
--
[source, javascript]
----
const { Client } = require('hazelcast-client');

const clientConfig = {
    network: {
        clusterMembers: [
            '<EXTERNAL-IP>'
        ]
    }
};
const client = await Client.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);
----
--

Go::
+
--
[source, go]
----
import (
	"log"

	"github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-go-client"
)

func main() {
	config := hazelcast.Config{}
	cc := &config.Cluster
	cc.Network.SetAddresses("<EXTERNAL-IP>")
	ctx := context.TODO()
	client, err := hazelcast.StartNewClientWithConfig(ctx, config)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
----
--

Python::
+
--
[source, python]
----
import logging
import hazelcast

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
    cluster_members=["<EXTERNAL-IP>"],
    use_public_ip=True,
)
----
--

====
+
Now you can start the application to fill the map.
+
[tabs]
====

Java::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
cd clients/java
mvn package
java -jar target/*jar-with-dependencies*.jar fill
----
--

NodeJS::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
cd clients/nodejs
npm install
npm start fill
----
--

Go::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
cd clients/go
go run main.go fill
----
--

Python::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
cd clients/python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py fill
----
--

====
+
You should see the following output.
+
[source, shell]
----
Successful connection!
Starting to fill the map with random entries.
Current map size: 2
Current map size: 3
Current map size: 4
Current map size: 5
Current map size: 6
Current map size: 7
Current map size: 8
Current map size: 9
Current map size: 10
----

== Step 3. Trigger External Backup

For triggering backup, you need `bucketURI` where backup data will be stored in and `secret` with credentials for accessing the given Bucket URI.

. Create Secret
+
Run one of the following command to create the secret according to the cloud provider you want to backup.

+
[tabs]
====

AWS::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=region=<region> \
	--from-literal=access-key-id=<access-key-id> \
	--from-literal=secret-access-key=<secret-access-key>
----
--

GCP::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-file=google-credentials-path=<service_account_json_file>
----
--

Azure::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> \
	--from-literal=storage-account=<storage-account> \
	--from-literal=storage-key=<storage-key>
----
--

====

. Trigger Backup
+
Run the following command to trigger backup
+
[source, shell]
----
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: HotBackup
metadata:
  name: hot-backup
spec:
  hazelcastResourceName: my-hazelcast
  bucketURI: "<bucketURI>"
  secret: <secret-name>
EOF
----

*Example URI -> "s3://operator-backup?prefix=hazelcast/2022-06-08-17-01-20/"*


. Check the Status of the Backup
+
Run the following command to check the status of the backup
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get hotbackup hot-backup
----
+
The status of the backup is displayed in the output.
+
[source,bash]
----
NAME         STATUS
hot-backup   Success
----

== Step 4. Restore from External Backup

. Delete the Hazelcast Cluster
+
Run the following command to delete the Hazelcast cluster
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete hazelcast my-hazelcast
----

. Create new Hazelcast Cluster
+
For restoring you will use the `HotBackup` resource you have created.
+
Run the following command to create the Hazelcast cluster. Before the Hazelcast cluster is started,
the operator starts the Restore Agent(InitContainer) which restores the backup data.
+
[source, shell]
----
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: Hazelcast
metadata:
  name: my-hazelcast
spec:
  clusterSize: 3
  licenseKeySecret: hazelcast-license-key
  persistence:
    baseDir: "/data/hot-restart/"
    clusterDataRecoveryPolicy: "FullRecoveryOnly"
    pvc:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      requestStorage: 8Gi
    restore:
      hotBackupResourceName: hot-backup
  exposeExternally:
    type: Smart
    discoveryServiceType: LoadBalancer
    memberAccess: NodePortExternalIP
EOF
----
+
As you may see, the agent configuration is not set. Thus, the operator directly use the latest stable version of the agent.

. Check the Cluster Status
+
Run the following commands to see the cluster status
+
[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get hazelcast my-hazelcast
NAME           STATUS    MEMBERS   EXTERNAL-ADDRESSES
my-hazelcast   Running   3/3       34.70.165.31:5701,34.70.165.31:8080
----
+
Since we recreate the Hazelcast cluster, services are also recreated. The `EXTERNAL-IP` may change.
+
After verifying that the cluster is `Running` and all the members are ready, run the following command to find the discovery service address.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get service my-hazelcast
NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                         AGE
my-hazelcast   LoadBalancer   10.168.25.113   34.70.165.31   5701:32653/TCP,8080:32162/TCP   69m
----
+
The field `EXTERNAL-IP` is the address of your Hazelcast cluster.

. Check the Map Size using the CLC (Option 1)
+
Before using CLC, it should be installed in your system. Check the installation instructions for CLC: xref:clc:ROOT:install-clc.adoc[]
+
Run the following command for adding the cluster config to the CLC.
+
[source, bash]
----
clc config add hz-2 cluster.name=dev cluster.address=<EXTERNAL-IP>
----
+
Run the following command to check the map size.
+
[source, bash]
----
clc -c hz-2 map size --name map1
----

. Check the Map Size by the Client (Option 2)
+
Configure the Hazelcast client to connect to the cluster external address as you did in <<Configure-Client, Configure the Hazelcast Client>>.
+
Now you can start the application to check the map size and see if the restore is successful.
